### A Story About Vinyl Peer: The Decentralized Symphony

Imagine a world where music, videos, and stories flow freely between people, unshackled from central servers and corporate gatekeepers. In this world, a group of innovators dreamed of a network where creativity could thrive—secure, resilient, and community-driven. They called it **Vinyl Peer**, a nod to the tactile joy of vinyl records and the peer-to-peer spirit of sharing. Built with TypeScript, Vinyl Peer is more than a tool; it’s a decentralized stage where media takes center stage, powered by **libp2p** for networking and **Helia/IPFS** for storage.

#### What is Vinyl Peer?

Vinyl Peer is a **modular, peer-to-peer (P2P) media-sharing network**. Picture it as a bustling marketplace of digital treasures—songs, films, posts—where every participant is both a vendor and a visitor. At its core, the `vinyl-peer-protocol` package sets up a libp2p node, weaving a web of connections among peers. It optionally pairs with Helia, an in-process IPFS node, to store and address content locally. But Vinyl Peer doesn’t stop there. It’s a monorepo—a collection of packages like `vinyl-peer-plugin-music`, `vinyl-peer-plugin-v`, and `vinyl-peer-cli`—that harmonize to create a platform for sharing, discovering, and managing media in a decentralized way.

Think of Vinyl Peer as a conductor leading an orchestra of plugins. Each plugin adds its own melody: music metadata extraction, microblogging, file replication, or analytics. Together, they play a symphony of features, all orchestrated through a single HTTP API and a robust plugin system.

#### What is Vinyl Peer Good For?

Vinyl Peer is your backstage pass to a decentralized media revolution. It’s good for:

- **Sharing Media Without Middlemen**: Upload a song or video, and peers can download or stream it directly—no cloud storage fees, no central point of failure.
- **Discovering Hidden Gems**: Search for music by genre or artist, get recommendations, or browse microblog posts from peers.
- **Ensuring Resilience**: With plugins like Reed-Solomon encoding or auto-replication, your files stay available even if some peers drop offline.
- **Building Community**: Post updates, follow peers, and create playlists in a decentralized social network.
- **Monitoring and Extending**: Track network health with analytics or craft custom features with the SDK generator.

Whether you’re a musician sharing tracks, a developer building a P2P app, or a tinkerer exploring decentralized tech, Vinyl Peer gives you the tools to create and connect.

#### What Does Vinyl Peer Do?

Vinyl Peer spins a rich tale of functionality:

1. **Uploads and Encrypts**: Drop a file—like an MP3 or video—and Vinyl Peer encrypts it with AES-GCM, tags it with a key version and IV, and stores it via IPFS or P2P streaming. Plugins can enrich it with metadata, like artist names or genres.
2. **Shares and Discovers**: Peers announce their files via libp2p PubSub. You can search for “jazz from the 60s” or get recommendations based on what you’ve uploaded, all powered by plugin magic.
3. **Downloads and Streams**: Fetch a file by its CID (content identifier), and Vinyl Peer decrypts it on the fly. Stream music over HTTP or download it to keep.
4. **Pins and Replicates**: Keep files local with pinning, or let the replication plugin spread them across the network for redundancy.
5. **Logs and Streams Events**: Every action—uploads, key rotations, plugin registrations—is logged with an HMAC signature in `vinyl-audit.log`. Meanwhile, real-time events stream via SSE at `/api/events`.
6. **Extends via Plugins**: From microblogging (think decentralized Twitter) to shard-based storage, plugins bolt on new features without touching the core.

It’s a living network, growing with every peer and plugin, all accessible through a CLI or HTTP server running on port 3001.

# Vinyl Peer Monorepo

**Vinyl Peer** is a modular, peer-to-peer (P2P) media-sharing network built with TypeScript—a decentralized stage where music, videos, and stories flow freely between peers. Powered by **libp2p** for networking and optionally **Helia/IPFS** for storage, it’s more than a tool; it’s a community-driven symphony of creativity. This monorepo houses packages that together form a robust, extensible platform for sharing, discovering, and managing media in a decentralized world.

## The Packages

- **`vinyl-peer-protocol`** - The core framework and plugin host, setting up the P2P network.
- **`vinyl-peer-plugin-music`** - Music magic: metadata extraction, search, and recommendations.
- **`vinyl-peer-plugin-analytics`** - Insights into node and file activity.
- **`vinyl-peer-plugin-replication`** - Auto-pinning for file availability.
- **`vinyl-peer-plugin-sdk-generator`** - Creates a TypeScript SDK for Vinyl nodes.
- **`vinyl-peer-plugin-v`** - Decentralized microblogging, like a P2P Twitter.
- **`vinyl-peer-plugin-rs`** - Reed-Solomon encoding for resilient storage.
- **`vinyl-peer-plugin-monitor`** - Prometheus metrics for node monitoring.
- **`vinyl-peer-plugin-name-service`** - Maps human-readable names to peer IDs.
- **`vinyl-peer-plugin-auto-replication`** - Smart, geo-aware replication.
- **`vinyl-peer-plugin-advanced-sharding`** - Advanced file sharding with Rabin and RS.
- **`vinyl-peer-plugin-filecoin-bridge`** - Archives files to Filecoin.
- **`vinyl-peer-cli`** - CLI and Express-based web server for interaction.

# Why Vinyl Peer?

Vinyl Peer isn’t just “IPFS + libp2p”—it’s a full framework that cuts through the complexity of building decentralized media apps. Here’s why it shines:

---

## 1. All-in-One Framework

### 1.1. Unified Networking & Storage

- **libp2p for P2P Transport**: Peer discovery, multiplexing, NAT traversal, and PubSub—ready out of the box.
- **Helia (In-Process IPFS)**: Embedded IPFS means no external daemons, just fast, in-memory file ops.

### 1.2. Opinionated File Management

- **AES-GCM Encryption**: Every upload is encrypted with a rotating key (1-byte version + 12-byte IV + ciphertext).
- **Key Rotation**: New key daily, keeping the last three versions for seamless decryption.
- **HMAC-Signed Audit Log**: Tamper-proof logging in `vinyl-audit.log` for every key action.
- **LevelDB Index**: Fast, searchable metadata via `fileDb`.

---

## 2. Plugin-Based Extensibility

Plugins are Vinyl Peer’s soul, letting you:

- **Listen** to events (`fileUploaded`, `peerConnected`).
- **Enhance Metadata** (e.g., ID3 tags for music).
- **Define Protocols** (bound with size limits).
- **Expose HTTP Routes** (under `/api/<namespace>`).

No need to rebuild the wheel—plugins snap into a standardized `PluginContext`.

---

## 3. Unified HTTP API

One Express server at `localhost:3001` serves:

- **Core Routes**: `/api/status`, `/api/upload`, `/api/download/:cid`, `/api/search`, `/api/pin/:cid`.
- **Plugin Routes**: `/api/music`, `/api/v`, `/api/rs`, etc.
- **Consistent Security**: CORS, Helmet, and rate limiting across all routes.

---

## 4. Audit Logging & Real-Time Events

- **Audit Log**: Signed JSON lines in `vinyl-audit.log` for every critical action.
- **SSE Feed**: `/api/events` streams live updates, replaying the last 20 events.

---

## 5. Vinyl Peer vs. Raw IPFS/Libp2p

- **Use Vinyl Peer** for encryption, plugins, HTTP API, and event streaming out of the box.
- **Use Raw IPFS/Libp2p** for minimal “put/get” with total control.

---

## 6. The Vinyl Protocol

Vinyl Peer defines a higher-level protocol atop libp2p and IPFS:

- **Wire**: Encrypted payloads, custom protocol strings.
- **Schema**: LevelDB for metadata, in-memory peers, HMAC logs.
- **HTTP**: Core + plugin routes, SSE events.

---

## 7. Why Choose Vinyl Peer?

Vinyl Peer saves you from wiring up encryption, metadata, plugins, and APIs. Focus on your app—music sharing, social networking, or resilient storage—while Vinyl Peer handles the P2P plumbing.
