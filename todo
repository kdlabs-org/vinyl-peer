5. Scheduled Backup & Archival Plugin
Goal: Automatically back up pinned files to a long‐term storage location (e.g. a remote IPFS gateway or another Vinyl node) on a scheduled cadence.

Key Capabilities

Configurable Schedule: Administrator sets cron‐like backup times (e.g. daily at 02:00 AM).

Backup Target: Could be another peer endpoint (via HTTP POST /api/upload) or an external IPFS HTTP API (/api/v0/add).

File Selection: Back up only those files where fileInfo.pinned === true (or those older than X days).

Backup Metadata: Maintain a backupDb in LevelDB that records { cid, backupTimestamp, targetLocation } so you don’t redundantly back up the same CID more than once per day/week.

HTTP Endpoints:

POST /api/backup/start → immediately trigger a backup job.

GET /api/backup/status → shows “last backup time,” “files pending,” “files succeeded/failed.”

DELETE /api/backup/:cid → remove that file from the backup queue.

Integration Points

Schedule with setInterval or a lightweight cron library inside the plugin’s start() method.

For each file returned by context.files.values() that matches backup criteria, do a Virtual “upload” to your backup target: e.g. if the target is another Vinyl node, call context.libp2p.dialProtocol(peerId, "/vinyl-network/upload"); if the target is an HTTP IPFS API, do fetch("http://gateway:5001/api/v0/add", formData).

Error Handling: If a backup fails, keep it in a “retry” queue for N attempts.

Why It’s Useful

Ensures that any peer’s pinned content is safely archived elsewhere, protecting against data loss if the peer goes offline or their disk fails.

In research or enterprise settings, it automates “compliance backups” so you always have a multi‐node or offsite copy.

2. Bandwidth Throttling & Prioritization Plugin
Goal: Allow each peer to set global or per‐file bandwidth limits, or prioritize certain streams (e.g. give live streaming higher priority, background uploads lower).

Key Capabilities

Rate Limiter: Wrap all outgoing/incoming streaming I/O (libp2p connections or Helia blockstore reads/writes) in a token‐bucket that caps throughput at e.g. X KB/s.

Priorities: Assign each file a priority tag (high, normal, low). The plugin schedules chunk reads/writes such that high‐priority streams get first access to available tokens.

HTTP Endpoints:

GET /api/bandwidth/settings → return current throttle rates and priority rules.

POST /api/bandwidth/set → body { globalRate: number (KB/s), defaultPriority: "low"|"normal"|"high" }.

POST /api/bandwidth/setPriority/:cid → { priority: "low"|"normal"|"high" }.

Integration Points

onFileDownloaded / onFileUploaded Hooks: Check the file’s priority and adjust token‐bucket allocation accordingly.

Libp2p Streams: When creating a libp2p.handle or dialing a new protocol, wrap the raw stream.sink/stream.source through a throttle transform.

Helia Block Fetch: Similarly, override helia.blockstore.get calls to apply rate limits when serving large files.

Why It’s Useful

Prevents a single large download from saturating a peer’s limited connection.

Ideal for nodes on metered or mobile networks: you can cap background syncs at 50 KB/s while allowing live video streams to burst up to 500 KB/s.

3. Offline Sync & Conflict Resolution Plugin
Goal: Enable peers to queue uploads or changes while offline, then automatically sync (and reconcile conflicts) once back online.

Key Capabilities

Local Change Queue: Maintain a LevelDB queue (syncQueue) of pending operations: file‐upload, file‐pin/unpin, metadata update. Buffer them while libp2p.isStarted === false.

Conflict Detection: On reconnect, for each queued operation, check if the remote state diverged. E.g. if two peers updated metadata for the same CID offline, compare timestamps.

Merge Strategy: Provide three conflict policies (configurable):

Last‐Writer‐Wins: Use the newer timestamp.

Manual‐Review: Mark conflicts and expose GET /api/sync/conflicts for manual resolution.

Merge Tags: If both changes were metadata tags (arrays), union them.

HTTP Endpoints:

GET /api/sync/status → shows pendingQueue length, lastSyncTime.

POST /api/sync/resolve → body { cid, resolution: { apply: "local"|"remote"|"merge", mergedMetadata? } }.

Integration Points

Wrap uploadFile(): If libp2p.isStarted === false, enqueue the upload instead of throwing. On peer:connect, flush the queue.

onEvent("fileUploaded") & onEvent("filePinned") Hooks: Record operations to the queue if offline.

After Flush: If a conflict arises (remote TTL older or newer), write a conflict record into conflictDb.

Why It’s Useful

Perfect for a peer that sporadically loses connectivity (e.g. mobile or laptop). Users can keep adding files while offline, and as soon as they reconnect to any other peer, everything syncs up automatically.

Ensures no data is lost, and conflicts are surfaced clearly.

4. Content Indexing & Full‐Text Search Plugin
Goal: Beyond filename searches, index file contents (e.g. text or code files) so peers can perform actual full‐text queries across stored documents.

Key Capabilities

Indexer: Whenever a new file is uploaded (and metadata type === text/plain or code‐type), download the decrypted payload, run a simple tokenizer (split on whitespace/punctuation), and index terms in a local inverted index (indexDb mapping term → set of CIDs).

Stop‐Word Removal & Stemming: Skip common stop words (the, and, is) and do lightweight stemming (e.g. strip trailing “s” or “ing”).

HTTP Endpoints:

GET /api/search/fulltext?q=foo+bar → returns NetworkFileInfo[] matching any term, ranked by number of term occurrences.

POST /api/search/reindex → force a full reindex of all current local files.

GET /api/search/indexStats → shows total number of terms indexed, number of files, etc.

Integration Points

onFileUploaded: If fileInfo.type.startsWith("text/") or matches a code MIME (e.g. application/javascript), schedule an async job to downloadFile(cid) → decode Buffer → extract text → update inverted index.

LevelDB Table: indexDb: term → JSON.stringify([cid1, cid2, …]). You can store frequency counts too if desired.

searchFiles(): Override or augment the default name‐based search to also query this index.

Why It’s Useful

Allows users to “grep” across a distributed file store. For example, if a code repository is stored in Vinyl, you can find “function parseDate” even if you don’t know the filename.

Great for document archives, wikis, or code‐sharing communities built on Vinyl.
